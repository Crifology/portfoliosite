    "My name is Mike Crifo, hailing out of Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  I am a newly trained\
    full stack developer, with emphasis on Javascript, HTML and CSS.  Prior to coding, I was associated\
    with the travel industry for over 19 years, in sales and management. \n\nFrom taking people around the globe \
    through airlines and cruise ships, to now taking them virtually through their iPhones and laptops from one\
    URL location to another, my goal is to create eye-catching and accessible user-friendly applications and websites\
    alike! I'm motivated to continue learning new skills and techniques for better application with the right company.\
